# swap

This project is a simple web application that allows users to swap tokens on the Base blockchain without having to pay for gas fees. It uses the [Pimlico](https://pimlico.io/) Paymaster and its Account Abstraction SDK to execute the swaps and [WalletConnect](https://reown.com/) to connect to the user's wallet.

## Demo

You can view the live demo of the project [here](https://swap.stablecoin.xyz/). You need to be on the Base blockchain.

After connecting your wallet, you can swap between [USDC](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913#code) and [SBC](https://basescan.org/token/0xfdcC3dd6671eaB0709A4C0f3F53De9a333d80798#code) tokens in either direction.

You don't need any ETH to pay for gas fees as our Paymaster will cover the fees for you.
